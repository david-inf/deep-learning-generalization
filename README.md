# Deep-learning-generalization

A work on generalization in deep learning

### Details

Supervised learning on CIFAR10

- Models:
    - MLP
    - (Simple-Net)
    - AlexNet
    - Inception-V3
- Optimization
    - Optimizer: SGD

## Experiments

Experiments for figure 1
- Loss per training step varying randomization test
- Time to overfit (reach zero-loss) againts label corruption for each network
- Test error against label corruption for each network

Experiments for figure 2
